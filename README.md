# Racine

Another WordPress starter theme for quick development, including Core theme features & basic template files.

It's very minimalist, as little styling as possible is included in the template files, and the style.css contains the classes required by the Theme Check test (see [Theme review](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review)). 

Racine can be used as a parent theme, or as a main theme by modifying the files and styles for your needs.

Included :

* KNACSS framework [(http://knacss.com)](http://knacss.com)
* Simple JS for responsive menu
* French translation
* Customizer ready
* WordPress SEO breadcrumbs
